            <p className='lead'>
              The goal of this project was to create a full-stack application
              that was served on Express and persisted data to a database. I
              chose Mongo for the database, JWT/Bcrypt/Cookies for
              authentication, and React-Bootstrap for styling. The user can
              search through the data to reutn a specific hosue with desired
              number of rooms and or bathrooms.
